% Optical simulation
%
% Example: propagation of a single channel OOK signal within a 100 km of 
%            a fully compensated fiber. 
%
% Try to change what happens by:
%       1) changing the duty cycle (RZ -> duty = 50%)
%       2) pulse roll-off in ELECTRICSOURCE
%       3) Cumulated nonlinear phase
