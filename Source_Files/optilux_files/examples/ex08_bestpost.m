% penalty up to 9.9 dB

% To gain feeling with x.eta and x.mu try to change them.

% removing the line x.saddle = 'y'.

%%%%%% now search for the optimal post compensation

% Is it the correct value? Let us answer by exhaustive search of

% Ok, the previous answer was right. However the function BEST_SP can fail 
% sometimes. For instance, it fails if the range of the OSNR is too small,
% so that the evaluation of the OSNR penalty returns NaN and the golden
% search algorithm do not know in which direction search the best value.
% The function might also fail when the initial bracket is too large. For
% instance, with the following bracket: 

x.dpost = [-10000 10000];
[be,bpost] = best_sp(1,x,pat);

fprintf('\nBest OSNR penalty = %f [dB]\n',be);
fprintf('Best post cumulated dispersion = %f [ps/nm]\n\n',bpost);

% we have the wrong answer!!! Be careful!
