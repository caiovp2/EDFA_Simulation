                       % approximation (see BER_KL)

% Note that the OSNR in b2b is 12.1 dB, hence we search the OSNR penalty
% within the range -1:10 around 12 dB. By this way we are able to measure
% penalty up to 9.9 dB

% To gain feeling with x.eta and x.mu try to change them.
% Try also to test the accuracy of the saddlepoint approximation by
% removing the line x.saddle = 'y'.

%%%%%% now search for the optimal post compensation

fprintf('\n ===== Results from best_sp ==========\n\n');
fprintf('\nBest OSNR penalty = %f [dB]\n',be);
fprintf('Best post cumulated dispersion = %f [ps/nm]\n\n',bpost);

% Let us now check the best post dispersion that maximizes the eye opening

[be,bpost] = best_eye(1,x,pat);

fprintf('\n ===== Results from best_eye ==========\n\n');
fprintf('\nBest eye closure penalty = %f [dB]\n',be);
fprintf('Best post cumulated dispersion = %f [ps/nm]\n\n',bpost);

% The two answers are different: optimizing the eye opening is not the same
% as optimizing the BER. The first is clearly a better answer, the second
% is faster.

% Please note that neither best_sp or best_eye change GSTATE.FIELDX. They
% operate over a copy of it.
